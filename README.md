RevUnit Exercise

Goals

1. Create 2 pages (at least), One showing all posts fetched from the json server + One showing comments/info from that post via click through

2. Filter posts by author

3. Filter posts by searching id (created new page/route for this)

Improvements:
Didn't use Unit Testing in this exercise. This is something that would help with organizing and possibly speeding up the completion of the project.

Filtering posts by id isn't 100% the way I'd like it to be operating.

Sayonara!
